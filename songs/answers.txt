I would characterize thir character as Orange (Oranges are the rebellious and bold type.
They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds) as there is a lot of danceability and a low amout of valence compared to energy.

The energy/danceability/valence is objective to each person. I would suggest to use the genre of music they are listing to the most be used to calculate
their aura.
