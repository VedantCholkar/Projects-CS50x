Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I expected the amount of time to increase in a linear way, yet it's not so. There is a big difference between 100000 simulations and 1000000 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would say after 1000 simulations the predictions would be good enough as it is not much greater than the times before.
